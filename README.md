# Credit Card Form App

## Overview

The **Credit Card Form App** is a web application designed for users to easily input and validate credit card information. It provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface to input and securely view details such as the card number, cardholder name, expiration date, and CVV.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app ensures a smooth and secure experience for entering sensitive credit card details.

## Features

- **Credit Card Validation**: The app validates credit card numbers using regular expressions to detect common card brands such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and others.
- **Real-time Formatting**: The card number is formatted as the user types, ensuring the information is easy to read and secure by masking sensitive digits.
- **Expiration Date Selection**: Convenient dropdown menus for selecting the card's expiration month and year, with automated year handling for the next 10 years.
- **Masked CVV Input**: The CVV is entered and displayed as asterisks for security purposes.
- **Dynamic Card Brand Recognition**: The app recognizes the credit card brand (e.g., Visa, MasterCard) based on the card number and displays the appropriate logo.
- **Masked Input for Security**: After the user inputs their CVV and card number, the values are masked for privacy and can be clicked to reveal the original numbers.
- **Form Submission**: When the user submits the form, the app collects and can log the data, ready for integration with backend services.
- **Automatic Expiry Date Adjustment**: The expiry year is set for the next 10 years, and the month dropdown is updated based on the current date to prevent expired selections.
